Volatile Core is the perfect foundation for any web app.  
It allows you to connect all and only the components you need in a flexible and efficient way.

A handlers (or *middlewares*) stack is used to pass data in line, from the first to the last handler.  
So you can perform actions downstream, then filter and manipulate the response upstream.

No handlers are bundled in this package.

## Installation

```Shell
$ go get -u github.com/volatile/core
```

## Usage

```Go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"log"
	"time"

	"github.com/volatile/core"
)

func main() {
	// Log
	core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
		start := time.Now()
		c.Next()
		log.Printf(" %s  %s  %s", c.Request.Method, c.Request.URL, time.Since(start))
	})

	// Response
	core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
		fmt.Fprint(c.ResponseWriter, "Hello, World!")
	})

	core.Run()
}
```

Your app is reachable at http://localhost:8080/.  
If you want to use a custom port, set the `-port` parameter when running your app.

Also, use the `-production` parameter when serving in a production environment.  
Some third-party handlers may have different behaviors following the environment.
