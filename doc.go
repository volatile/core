/*
Package core is the perfect foundation for any web app as it's designed to have the best balance between readability, flexibility and performance.

It provides a pure handler (or "middleware") stack so you can perform actions downstream, then filter and manipulate the response upstream.

No handlers or helpers are bundled in the Core: it does one thing and does it well.
You can find official packages below.

For a complete documentation, see the Volatile website (http://volatile.whitedevops.com).
You can also read all the code (~100 LOC) within minutes.

Installation

In the terminal:

	$ go get github.com/volatile/core

Usage

Example of a logger followed by the response writing:

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"log"
		"time"

		"github.com/volatile/core"
	)

	func main() {
		// Log
		core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
			start := time.Now()
			c.Next()
			log.Printf(" %s  %s  %s", c.Request.Method, c.Request.URL, time.Since(start))
		})

		// Response
		core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
			fmt.Fprint(c.ResponseWriter, "Hello, World!")
		})

		core.Run()
	}

By default, your app is reachable at http://localhost:8080.

Note that these parameters are preset:

-address to set a custom listening address.
The value is saved in Address.

-production to switch on production environment settings.
Some third-party handlers may have different behaviors depending on the environment.
The value is saved in Production.

It's up to you to call flag.Parse() in your main function if you want to use them.

Also, this package is fully compatible with the net/http.Handler interface:

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"net/http"

		"github.com/volatile/core"
	)

	func main() {
		hs := core.NewHandlersStack()

		hs.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
			fmt.Fprint(c.ResponseWriter, "Hello, World!")
		})

		http.ListenAndServe(":8080", hs)
	}
