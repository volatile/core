/*
Package core is the perfect foundation for any web app as it's designed to have the best balance between readability, flexibility and performance.

It provides a pure handler (or "middleware") stack so you can perform actions downstream, then filter and manipulate the response upstream.

No handlers or helpers are bundled in the Core: it does one thing and does it well.
You can find official packages below.

For a complete documentation, see the Volatile website (http://volatile.whitedevops.com).
You can also read all the code (~100 LOC) within minutes.

Usage

Here is an example of a logger followed by the response writing:

	package main

	import (
		"fmt"
		"log"
		"time"

		"github.com/volatile/core"
	)

	func main() {
		// Log
		core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
			start := time.Now()
			c.Next()
			log.Printf(" %s  %s  %s", c.Request.Method, c.Request.URL, time.Since(start))
		})

		// Response
		core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
			fmt.Fprint(c.ResponseWriter, "Hello, World!")
		})

		core.Run()
	}

By default, your app is reachable at http://localhost:8080.

Use the -address parameter to set a custom listening address.
The value is saved in core.Address.

Use the -production parameter when serving in a production environment.
Some third-party handlers may have different behaviors depending on the environment.
The value is saved in core.Production.
