/*
Package core provides a pure handlers (or middlewares) stack so you can perform actions downstream, then filter and manipulate the response upstream.

The handlers stack

A handler is a function that receives a context.
It can be registered with Use and has the possibility to break the sream or to continue with the next handler in the stack.

Example of a logger followed by the response writing:

	// Log
	core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
		start := time.Now()
		c.Next()
		log.Printf(" %s  %s  %s", c.Request.Method, c.Request.URL, time.Since(start))
	})

	// Response
	core.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
		fmt.Fprint(c.ResponseWriter, "Hello, World!")
	})

	// Run server
	core.Run()

When using Run, your app is reachable at http://localhost:8080 by default.

If you need more flexibility, you can make a new handlers stack, which is fully compatible with the net/http.Handler interface:

	hs := core.NewHandlersStack()

	hs.Use(func(c *core.Context) {
		fmt.Fprint(c.ResponseWriter, "Hello, World!")
	})

	http.ListenAndServe(":8080", hs)

Here is the visualization of the serving flow when using log, secure and compress handlers:

	request              open
	  |- log             start
	  |--- secure        start
	  |----- compress    start
	  |------- response  write
	  |----- compress    end
	  |--- secure        end
	  |- log             end
	request              close

Flags

These flags are preset:

	-address
		The address to listen and serving on.
		Value is saved in Address.
	-production
		Run the server in production environment.
		Some third-party handlers may have different behaviors depending on the environment.
		Value is saved in Production.

It's up to you to call
	flag.Parse()
in your main function if you want to use them.

Panic recovering

When using Run, your server always recovers from panics, logs the error with stack, and sends a 500 Internal Server Error.
If you want to use a custom handler on panic, give one to HandlePanic.

Handlers and helpers

No handlers or helpers are bundled in the core: it does one thing and does it well.
That's why you need to import all and only the handlers or helpers you need:
